What is Redis?
Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open-source advanced NoSQL key-value data store used as a
database, cache, and message broker. The data is stored in a dictionary format having key-value pairs. It is
typically used for short term storage of data that needs fast retrieval. Redis does backup data to hard drives
to provide consistency
